## 4. Launch & Deployment

### (1) Prerequisites and Installation

For your local development environment, you will need Node.js.
We urge you to install the exact version v20.11.0 which comes with the npm package manager. You can download it here.
If you are confused about which download to choose, feel free to use these direct links:

MacOS: node-v20.11.0.pkg
Windows 32-bit: node-v20.11.0-x86.msi
Windows 64-bit: node-v20.11.0-x64.msi
Linux: node-v20.11.0.tar.xz (use this installation guide if you are new to Linux)
If you happen to have a package manager the following commands can be used:

Homebrew: brew install node@20.11.0
Chocolatey: choco install nodejs-lts --version=20.11.0
After the installation, update the npm package manager to 10.4.0 by running npm install -g npm@10.4.0
You can ensure the correct version of node and npm by running node -v and npm --version, which should give you v20.11.0 and 10.4.0 respectively.
Before you start your application for the first time, run this command to install all other dependencies, including React:

`npm install`

Next, you can start the app with:

`npm run dev`

Now you can open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use a Chrome-based browser).
The client will send HTTP requests to the server which can be found here.
In order for these requests to work, you need to install and start the server as well.


### (2) Test

Testing is optional, and you can run the tests with `npm run test`
This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode.

### (2) Build

Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance:
The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.

See the section about deployment for more information.
